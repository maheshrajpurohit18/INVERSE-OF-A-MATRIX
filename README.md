# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
import numpy as np
### Step 2:
We have created a matrix using array and we will find inverse of this.
### Step 3: 
We can find the inverse of the martix by using np.linalg.inv and passing the matrix.
### Step 4:
Finally, print the value of the inverse of the matrix.

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by:maheshrajpurohit
#RegisterNumber:22008605
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
r=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(r)
```
## Output:
